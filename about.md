is a dedicated AI researcher who delves deeply into understanding neural architectures modeled on human innate systems.

# Research Interests

- Designing Neural Architectures Modeled on Human Cognitive Systems

> Cognitive systems play a pivotal role in advancing neural architectures for perception, cognition and reasoning. Research aims to reach optimal neural architectures by aligning them with human cognition.

- Developing Effective Memory Recall for Model-Acquired Knowledge

> While deep models excel in memorization, effectively retrieving the stored knowledge remains a challenge. Research encompasses a wide range of systems for accessing and utilizing knowledge, from information retrieval to understanding complex concepts of reasoning.

- Deep Learning for Language Acquisition with Minimal Data

> Large language models (LLMs) achieve language comprehension through vast amounts of data, whereas humans can acquire language from only a small amount of experience, known as the "poverty of the stimulus" argument. Research seeks deep learning methods that can effectively learn language with limited data by leveraging linguistic features.
